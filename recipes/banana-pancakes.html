    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Crowd-pleasing banana pancakes made from scratch that are ready in minutes. A fun twist on ordinary pancakes.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>An egg</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Bananas</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <h4>Mix</h4>
        <li>Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) in one bowl and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed bananas) in another bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients, then stir until they're incorporated. It's OK if your batter is slightly lumpy. </li>
        <h4>Cook</h4>
        <li>Pour the batter in Â¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan or griddle over medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes, flip with a spatula, and cook for another few minutes (or until each side is golden brown). </li>
        <h4>Serve</h4>
        <li>Serve your banana pancakes immediately. They're delicious alone or with your favorite pancake toppings.</li>
    </ol>

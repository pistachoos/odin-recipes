With this project I will put the knowledge I have gained from this course so far. This includes basic command line activities, working with Git and HTML foundations.
After finishing this project I hope to become more comfortable with the afore mentioned subjects and continue learning new things in the course.

The project will be a recipe website in brutalist web design.
